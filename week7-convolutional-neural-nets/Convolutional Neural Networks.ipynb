    "# Convolutions and max-pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of convolutional neural networks is the key idea of convolutions. A convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function. Convolutions have rigorous mathematical theory behind them, and if you're interested in learning about that, we recommend Wikipedia's post on convolutions and Christopher Olah's explanation of convolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each convolution operation is followed by a non-linearity, after which a `max-pooling` operation is performed. The purpose of the max-pooling operation is to downsample the activations from the convolution step. It reduces overfitting by representing a set of activations as only the \"most important\" (in a sense) activation in that region. It also reduces computational cost due to a smaller dimensionality. Finally, max-pooling allows us to make assumptions regarding the presence of important features in certain layers. "

    "# Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a (relatively) simple convolutional neural network model. It'll be composed of two convolutional layers, each of which is followed by a max-pooling operation to reduce dimensionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then follow these two convolutional layers with two fully connected layers, similar to those in the vanilla neural network that we implemented last week. However, we're also going to add an operation known as **dropout**. Dropout is an interesting concept that allows large neural networks to prevent from overfitting on the training dataset. With dropout, we discard a predetermined proportion of a hidden layer's activations, so that they don't contribute anything to what the next layer computes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout has many interesting consequences. First of all, it introduces a degree of per-(hidden) layer sparsity when we are training: at any given layer, a certain proportion of the inputs into that layer will be zero. Moreover, since we sample which neurons in particular that we wish to discard at a per-step granularity, we can think of this as training an ensemble of (correlated) neural networks, since the active neurons at each particular training step are zero. When we predict using our network (and don't use dropout), it's as if we're getting a prediction from an ensemble of neural networks, without having to train an ensemble in the first place (which is much more expensive). \n",
    "\n",
    "A few questions to sanity check your understanding of dropout: \n",
    " 1. Why should we not use dropout in the final layer? \n",
    " 2. Why do we not use dropout when testing the network accuracy on testing datasets? Why is it a bad idea to use in predictions? \n",
    " 3. Which dropout probability corresponds to the most number of ways to have the neurons in a hidden layer active/inactive? (hint: think combinatorics). \n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, we will have a output layer that does a standard matrix multiplication to generate class predictions. "
